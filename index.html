       <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the 
           knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was 
           achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills 
           from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills 
           that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed 
           in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of 
        literate scholarship in Western Europe.[9] The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle 
        Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval 
        universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.[4] During the High Middle Ages, 
        Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval 
        universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged 
        freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, 
        including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of 
        Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,[10] and Saint 
        Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.[11] Founded in 1088, the University 
        of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.</p>

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition 
        of knowledge, 
        skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, 
        discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, 
        however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings 
        and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered 
        educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

        Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary 
        school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
        
        A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most 
        regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, 
        and in particular for evidence-based education.</p>
